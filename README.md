# String Matching Algorithms
Compare implementations of string matching algorithms in C. 

## Overview
`algorithm_comparison.c` is the main driver module. It is responsible for:
- Defining dictionary of valid words that will be suggested
- Defining words that will be tested as input
- Testing each string matching algorithm

## Algorithms
- [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)

## Build
To build this project, run `make` from the root directory
